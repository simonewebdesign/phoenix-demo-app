# Phoenix Demo App

Nothing to see here. The only purpose of this app is to act as a test repo for https://github.com/depchecker/webapp.

## Getting started

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
